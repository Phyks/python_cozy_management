Description: Cozy is an app-based personal cloud you host at home
 Cozy is an app-based personal cloud you host at home. It turns a low-cost
 piece of hardware like a Raspberry Pi 2 or an online VPS into a powerful app
 platform. It comes with common applications: a contacts manager, a calendar, a
 webmail and a filebox. An Android app allows you to sync your contacts,
 calendars and files with your mobile. Last but not least, the Cozy Community
 has built many personal tools like a feed reader, a bank operation manager or
 an IRC client (100 000 apps were downloaded in 2015).
